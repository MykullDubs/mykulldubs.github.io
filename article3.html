 <p>12 News journalist Bianca Bono joins us live in the studio to discuss the story. Homebuilder Taylor Morrison wanted Cy Porter to stop posting any videos to social media about its homes, claiming his videos violated state standards. But the board disagreed, opting for a letter of concern for Porter instead of discipline.</p>

    <p>If you're on social media, you've likely seen Cy Porter of Sci Fi Home Inspections. He specializes in new construction homes in Arizona, and his videos often expose flaws he finds, informing homeowners of their rights under Arizona law. But his inspection videos showing Taylor Morrison homes prompted the company to file a complaint against him with the Arizona State Board of Technical Registration, which regulates Porter's industry and his license. In the complaint, Taylor Morrison described Porter's posts as harassing, falsified, and bullying.</p>

    <p>This week, the board held a hearing to discuss the complaint. The investigator assigned to the case said there was no evidence to show Porter lied in any of his videos. "We conducted interviews, reviewed many of the videos at the conclusion of the investigation. We were unable to find any verifiable violations of the board's Practice Act," the investigator stated.</p>

    <p>A Taylor Morrison representative called for Porter's license to be suspended. Board members had differing opinions. One called for discipline, stating, "We are professionals and we need to treat people as professionals." Another said there was no violation and Porter's videos are protected: "We're saying that we can't find specific violations of conduct and yet we're fishing for some kind of something to hang our hat on."</p>

    <p>Ultimately, the board did not discipline Porter, finding no violation of board statutes or rules. Instead, they voted to issue a letter of concern, specifically calling out a video Porter posted in March. The board said he displayed evidence of a gas leak with an audio recording that was not associated with the leak. Porter says that video was not showing a home inspection; instead, it was satirical and made as a joke for his social media followers.</p>

    <p>In a statement, a Taylor Morrison spokesperson said, "We respect the board's decision that the conduct was troubling enough to warrant issuance of a letter of concern."</p>

    <p>Cy Porter said this entire process has been incredibly stressful but believes the matter with Taylor Morrison is now concluded. He started making the videos because there's a notion that new homes don't need inspections, when in reality they do. He says it's all in the interest of transparency.</p>
