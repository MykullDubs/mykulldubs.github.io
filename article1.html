    <p>Visiting New Zealand just got more expensive. The government announced Tuesday it will nearly triple entry fees for tourists to $100 NZD (or $62 USD). Authorities argued it would ensure visitors contributed to public services and high-quality experiences while visiting the country. Matt Ducey, the New Zealand Minister for Tourism and Hospitality, said, "What we want to do is shift some of the cost from the taxpayer to the visitor and ultimately what we want to do is grow tourism. Uh, we've got an ambitious target to double our exports as a country over the next 10 years. Tourism is our second-biggest export earner."

    </p>
    <p>The move hasn't gone down well with the holiday sector. New Zealand's tourism industry association fears the fee will put visitors off while it recovers from the hit it took during the pandemic. Gavin Oliver, Managing Director of Ecozip Adventure, said, "I think we're saddened by it. Um, it went to consultation; there were a number of levels proposed—um, $50, $70, and $100—and we advocated for $50. We felt there should be an increase, um, but this is a very, very significant increase at a time when the tourism sector is struggling to recover."
    </p>
    <p>A $35 NZD fee was introduced in July 2019 but hasn't proven enough to cover costs associated with so many visitors. New Zealand has struggled with the impact of tourists on the natural environment and with infrastructure stretched by the large numbers. The government said the new fee was competitive, and it was confident the country would remain an attractive destination. Official data released earlier Tuesday showed travel export receipts for the year ended June 30 were around $9 billion USD, down 5% from before the pandemic. Data also showed visitor numbers are roughly 80% of levels before the pandemic border closures.

    <ul>
      <li>Comprehension & Opinion: Why has the New Zealand government decided to increase the entry fee for tourists? Do you agree or disagree with this decision? Why?</li>
      <li>Critical Thinking: How might the increased entry fee impact New Zealand's tourism industry in the short term and the long term?</li>
      <li>Cultural Awareness: In your opinion, is it fair to ask tourists to contribute to the cost of public services and infrastructure in a country they are visiting? Why or why not?</li>
