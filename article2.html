    <p>This is the culmination of decades of research. The future would be a world where you wouldn't have to go on an organ transplant list, but instead have access to an unlimited supply of healthy, young organs. </p>

<p>Experiments in pig organ transplants have ramped up in recent years, with companies racing to get ready for clinical trials as soon as next year to test this new technology on a larger scale. </p>

<h2>United Therapeutics' Facility</h2>

<p>The Associated Press got an exclusive look at United Therapeutics' new facility in the mountains of Virginia, where pigs for clinical trials are raised. The facility includes a cloning lab, a research farm, and a facility where they are raising the pigs for future clinical trials.</p>

<h3>Cloning Lab</h3>

<p>In the cloning lab, genetically modified piglets are cloned every week. Scientists start with a pig egg cell and carefully remove its DNA, leaving a cell with no genes. Later, they add genes that have been edited to make the pig's organs more suitable for people. These gene edits ensure the pigs only grow to a certain size or block the production of proteins that could trigger rejection. </p>

<h3>Research Farm</h3>

<p>The genetically modified pigs live at the research farm, where organs are retrieved for animal-to-human transplant experiments. </p>

<h3>Designated Pathogen-Free Facility</h3>

<p>United Therapeutics' third facility is the first of its kind designated pathogen-free facility. This facility is designed to keep out pathogens that are of concern specifically for humans and organs. The building doesn't look like a farm, but this is where the herd of pigs that will eventually supply organs for clinical trials are raised. They are behind a protected barrier within the building, and everything going in and out of the barrier is decontaminated. Every person who goes in to care for the pigs goes through a rigorous timed shower to make sure no unwanted germs can get to the pigs, making these some of the cleanest pigs in the world.</p>

<h2>The Future</h2>

<p>United Therapeutics hopes that clinical trials are around the corner. The FDA has to decide whether the body of data is sufficient to allow them to go forward with clinical trials. This is the culmination of everything in the field of xenotransplantation happening in the last few years, and the next few years are going to be exciting as we go to full-on clinical trials for heart and kidney transplants.</p>

      <li>Comprehension & Opinion: Why has the New Zealand government decided to increase the entry fee for tourists? Do you agree or disagree with this decision? Why?</li>
      <li>Critical Thinking: How might the increased entry fee impact New Zealand's tourism industry in the short term and the long term?</li>
      <li>Cultural Awareness: In your opinion, is it fair to ask tourists to contribute to the cost of public services and infrastructure in a country they are visiting? Why or why not?</li>
